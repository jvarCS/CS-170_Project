### Project Description
This was a class project for CS-170 which is an AI course at the University of California, Riverside. The goal for this project was to develop a solution to the Eight-Puzzle using various searching algorithms such as Uniform Search Cost, A* with Misplaced Tile heuristic, and A* with Euclidean Distance heuristic. 
Various stats are displayed after a solution is found with the chosen search algorithm, and can be used to benchmark the efficiency of each algorithm on a common puzzle. Source files include comments on most lines of code to explain their purpose and give a glimpse into my thought process
while working through the project.
